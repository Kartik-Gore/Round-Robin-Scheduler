****🔄 Round Robin Scheduler Visualizer****
An interactive React-based CPU scheduling visualizer designed to demonstrate the Round Robin scheduling algorithm in a simple and intuitive way.

**📖 About the Project**
The Round Robin Scheduler Visualizer is a web application built using React that helps users understand how CPU processes are scheduled using the Round Robin algorithm.
By allowing dynamic input of processes and time quantum, this project turns a theoretical Operating Systems concept into an engaging, hands-on learning experience.

**✨ Key Features**
  ⚛️ Built with React for a smooth UI experience
  ⏱️ Adjustable Time Quantum
  ➕ Add, edit, and delete processes dynamically
  🎲 Generate random process data
  📊 Compare Round Robin vs FCFS scheduling
  🧠 Analyze the effect of different quantum sizes
  🌗 Light & Dark mode support
  📱 Fully responsive design

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
  Frontend: React (Vite)
  Language: JavaScript
  Styling: CSS / Tailwind CSS
  Version Control: Git & GitHub

**🧠 Algorithm Overview**
  Round Robin Scheduling assigns a fixed time quantum to each process and cycles through them in order.
  It ensures fair CPU allocation and improves response time, especially in time-sharing systems.

**🎓 Learning Outcomes**
  Practical understanding of CPU scheduling
  Clear visualization of Round Robin behavior
  Hands-on experience with React
  Improved problem-solving and UI design skills

**🚀 Future Improvements**
  Gantt chart visualization
  Waiting time & turnaround time calculation
  Additional scheduling algorithms (SJF, Priority)
  Online deployment (GitHub Pages)
